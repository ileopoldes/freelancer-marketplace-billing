# Phase 5: Enhanced Discount & Credit Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 5 significantly enhances the BillForge billing system with sophisticated discount management, advanced credit handling, and robust proration capabilities for mid-cycle changes. This phase builds upon the solid foundation from Phases 1-4 to provide enterprise-grade billing flexibility.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Discount Engine

**Location**: `src/services/pricing/DiscountEngine.ts`

#### Features:
- **Multiple Discount Types**: Percentage, fixed amount, usage-based, and bulk/tiered discounts
- **Flexible Scheduling**: One-time, recurring, progressive, and conditional discount application
- **Rule-Based Application**: Sophisticated conditions based on billing cycle, customer type, invoice amount, etc.
- **Validation & Safety**: Prevents invalid discount configurations and over-application

#### Implementation Highlights:
```typescript
// Promotional discount for new customers
const newCustomerDiscount = DiscountEngine.createPromotionalDiscount(
  'new-customer-20',
  'New Customer 20% Off',
  20,  // 20% discount
  3    // First 3 billing cycles
);

// Volume-based discount
const volumeDiscount = DiscountEngine.createVolumeDiscount(
  'volume-discount',
  'High Volume 15% Off',
  500, // Minimum $500 invoice
  15   // 15% discount
);
```

### 2. Advanced Credit Management

**Location**: `src/services/billing/CreditManager.ts`

#### Features:
- **Credit Types**: Manual, refund, adjustment, and promotional credits
- **Expiration Management**: Configurable expiration dates with automatic cleanup
- **Smart Application Logic**: Priority-based credit application (promotional > refund > manual > adjustment)
- **Partial Credit Consumption**: Handles partial credit usage with remainder tracking
- **Credit Transfer**: Inter-customer credit transfers with audit trails
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive credit utilization reporting

#### Implementation Highlights:
```typescript
// Issue promotional credit with expiration
await creditManager.issuePromotionalCredit(
  customerId,
  createMoney('100'),
  'Welcome Bonus',
  90 // Expires in 90 days
);

// Transfer credits between customers
const { debitCredit, creditCredit } = await creditManager.transferCredit(
  fromCustomerId,
  toCustomerId,
  createMoney('25'),
  'Account consolidation'
);
```

### 3. Enhanced Proration Engine

**Location**: `src/services/pricing/ProrationEngine.ts`

#### Features:
- **Mid-Cycle Plan Changes**: Accurate proration for upgrades and downgrades
- **Multiple Adjustment Processing**: Handle complex sequences of plan changes
- **Usage Proration**: Pro-rate usage charges for partial periods
- **Grace Period Support**: Configurable grace periods for service changes
- **Month-End Handling**: Robust handling of month-end edge cases and leap years

#### Implementation Highlights:
```typescript
// Calculate mid-cycle plan change
const result = prorationEngine.calculateMidCyclePlanChange(
  {
    changeDate: new Date('2024-01-15'),
    oldPlanAmount: createMoney('100'),
    newPlanAmount: createMoney('150'),
    reason: 'Plan upgrade'
  },
  billingStart,
  billingEnd
);

// Process multiple adjustments
const adjustmentResult = prorationEngine.processMidCycleAdjustments(
  adjustments,
  billingPeriodStart,
  billingPeriodEnd,
  basePlanAmount
);
```

### 4. Enhanced Invoice Generator Integration

**Location**: `src/services/billing/InvoiceGenerator.ts`

#### Enhancements:
- **Automatic Discount Application**: Seamless integration with DiscountEngine
- **Enhanced Credit Application**: Uses advanced CreditManager for optimal credit usage
- **Comprehensive Line Items**: Detailed breakdown of all charges, discounts, and credits
