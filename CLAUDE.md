# Freelancer Marketplace Billing System - CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive billing system for a freelancer marketplace, implementing multi-tenant architecture with sophisticated pricing models. The system handles pay-as-you-go billing, prepaid credit packages, and seat-based subscriptions across Organizations â†’ Entities â†’ Teams â†’ Users.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Structure
- **Organizations**: Top-level billing entities with billing email and domain
- **Entities**: Sub-organizations within an organization (e.g., departments, projects)
- **Teams**: Groups within entities with specific billing models
- **Users**: Individual users with roles and seat allocations

### Core Billing Models

#### 1. Pay-as-You-Go Pricing
- Real-time event processing with marketplace events
- Tiered bulk discounts for high-volume usage
- Immediate credit deduction from entity balances
- Implemented in `PayAsYouGoPricer.ts` and `TieredUsagePricer.ts`

#### 2. Prepaid Credit Packages
- Entity-level credit balances with expiration tracking
- Credit limit enforcement per user
- Credit package purchase and management
- Implemented in `CreditPackageManager.ts` and `EntityCreditBalance` model

#### 3. Seat-Based Subscriptions
- Monthly/annual billing with proration support
- Seat count management with utilization tracking
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Implemented in `SeatBasedPricer.ts` and `ProrationEngine.ts`

### Key Services

## Technical Patterns

### Money Handling
All monetary values use the `Money` type from `@marketplace/shared` with proper decimal precision:
```typescript
import { Money, createMoney, addMoney, multiplyMoney } from '@marketplace/shared';
```

### Database Operations
All database operations use Prisma with proper transaction handling:
```typescript
await this.prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Database operations
});
```

### Event Processing
Events are processed through the `MarketplaceEventProcessor` with proper validation:
```typescript
const result = await this.eventProcessor.processEvent(event);
```

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling with proper error types and logging:
```typescript
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error, context });
  throw new BillingError('Operation failed', error);
}
```
