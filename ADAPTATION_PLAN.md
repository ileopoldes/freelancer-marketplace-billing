# Adaptation Plan - Scenario #2: Multi-Format Billing Solution

## Exercise Scope Validation

### Chosen Feature: Multi-Format Billing Solution

**Why chosen**: The billing system demonstrates complex business logic, multi-tenant architecture, and integration patterns that showcase comprehensive backend development skills.

### Actual Requirements (Must-Have)

#### Core Billing Models

1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Charge per project posted or freelancer hired
2. **Prepaid Credits**: Companies buy credit packages (no expiration, no notifications)
3. **Seat-based**: Monthly/annual subscription per team member

#### Simplified Constraints

- **One billing model per company** (not per team/project)
- **No credit expiration** (simplified management)
- **No email notifications** (out of scope)
- **Monthly/yearly invoices** (no individual event invoices)
- **Immediate access revocation** (no grace periods)
- **Asynchronous permission updates** (eventual consistency)
- **Generic payment integration** (no actual provider needed)
- **Automatic renewals** (no manual intervention)

### Current Implementation Status

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Organizations → Entities → Teams → Users
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Event processing for project posting and freelancer hiring
- **Prepaid Credits**: Credit packages without expiration
- **Seat-based Subscriptions**: Monthly/annual billing cycles
- **Credit Limits**: Per-user credit limits within entities
- **Overage Handling**: Automatic fallback to invoicing

#### ❌ Over-Engineered (Beyond Scope)

- **Credit expiration notifications**: Not required (credits don't expire)
- **Email notifications**: Not required for exercise
- **Complex audit trails**: Not mentioned in requirements
- **Bulk event processing**: Not required for basic implementation
- **Webhook systems**: Not required for exercise
- **Payment processor integration**: Generic design sufficient

## Test Coverage Analysis

  - Edge cases with zero/large seat counts

### Missing Test Coverage

#### Critical Gaps

- **❌ Error Handling and Edge Cases**
  - Limited database connection failure tests
  - Missing concurrent operation tests
  - No rate limiting tests

#### Integration Test Gaps

- **❌ End-to-End Workflows**
  - No multi-tenant billing workflow tests
  - Missing cross-service integration tests

- **❌ Database Transaction Tests**
  - No rollback scenario tests
  - Missing concurrent update tests
  - No data consistency tests

### Test Coverage Targets

- **Current Coverage**: ~25-30% (based on implemented features)
- **Target Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Priority Areas**: Event processing, credit management, subscription lifecycle

## Code Quality

### Conformance

- **ESLint and Prettier**: Configured with rules enforcing coding standards.
- **Type Safety**: Strong focus on TypeScript and Zod schemas for validation.

### Improvements Needed

- **Function Length & Complexity**: May need review to ensure no violations of complexity or length limits.
- **Consistent Commenting and Documentation**: Enhancement needed.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Testing and Quality Assurance

#### 1.1 Unit Test Coverage
